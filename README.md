Briefly summarize your client, Artemis Financial, and their software requirements. Who was the client? What issue did they want you to address?

  Artemis Financial is a client of Global Rain, a software engineering company that specializes in custom software design. Artemis Financial is a consulting company that develops individualized financial plans including savings, retirement, and investments. They wanted to modernize their operations while using the most current and effective software security. They ultimately wanted our expertise on protecting their RESTful web application from external threats.
  
What did you do very well when you found your client’s software security vulnerabilities? Why is it important to code securely? What value does software security add to a company’s overall wellbeing?

  I was able to refactor my code after running a vulnerability report. This allowed me to eliminate all of the found vulnerabilities. Coding securely helps keep people and their sensitive information safe. This helps companies to keep their customers' trust and to gain new customers. It also helps the users stay safe while using the application.

What part of the vulnerability assessment was challenging or helpful to you?

  Refactoring the code was the most difficult part for me. I was able to figure out how to generate my reports and use the console effectively, but getting the code to work correctly took me a long time.

How did you increase layers of security? In the future, what would you use to assess vulnerabilities and decide which mitigation techniques to use?

  I increased security by implementing keys and dependency check reports. I also used a HTTPS secure connection.

How did you make certain the code and software application were functional and secure? After refactoring the code, how did you check to see whether you introduced new vulnerabilities?

  I made sure the code was functional and secure by testing it rigorously. Continous testing and updating is crucial to an application's success.

What resources, tools, or coding practices did you use that might be helpful in future assignments or tasks?

  I find YouTube to be the most helpful. The 24/7 tutors were also helpful.

Employers sometimes ask for examples of work that you have successfully completed to show your skills, knowledge, and experience. What might you show future employers from this assignment?

  I would show them the refactored code and dependency reports for the before and after of fixing the vulnerabilities.
